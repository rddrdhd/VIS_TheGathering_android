VIS_TheGathering_android is mobile client in Java for my [other project](https://github.com/rddrdhd/VIS_TheGathering).

Optimalized for 1080x2280 resolution phone with [Android 9 (API level 28)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0.html).

Implemented just three use-cases yet. 
* adding deck
